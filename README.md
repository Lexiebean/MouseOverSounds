# MouseOverSounds
A Vanilla Warcraft (1.12.1) addon that plays a warning sound when you mouseover a rare, elite or dangerous mob. 

**This addon was not created by me. It was created by "Klas" a member of \<Still Alive\>.**

MouseOverSounds is highly customisable, allowing you to select how much higher level (or lower) a mob should be for each warning sound.  
Optionally, any mob that is not a Warrior (ie. Casters, Healers, etc.) will have "+2" added to their level to help highlight them.  
Example: You have are lvl 20, you "Medium Warning set to "2" and you come across a level 20 caster. The Medium Warning sound will still play. Even though the mob is not level 22.

`You can find the options for MouseOverSounds in the game's Main Menu (Esc).`

A small sound can also be played for any mob that gives exp, is a mob needed for a quest (if you have [pfQuest](http://shagu.org/pfQuest/) installed).  
A sound will also play any time you mouseover a chest. Or herb/mine if you have those professions.

Install location should be: `..\Interface\AddOns\MouseOverSounds`
